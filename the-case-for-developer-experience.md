# The Case for ‘Developer Experience’

- [The Case for ‘Developer Experience’](https://future.a16z.com/the-case-for-developer-experience/)

- Question: How exactly are they supposed to manage and coordinate these fast-moving, heterogeneous systems — and free themselves to build?
- We’ve simplified the narrative around what developers want.
- developer experience is the sum total of how developers interface with their tools, end-to-end, day-in and day-out.
- abstraction: making models that can be used and reused without having to rewrite things when certain implementation details change.
- What I needed here wasn’t more abstraction, but to embrace the complexity of the software and tech stacks.
- it’s far more empowering to the developer to help them explore and embrace existing complexity, rather than introduce more complexity when trying to automate things “away.”
- Developers work in rainforests, not planned gardens
- In many cases, what developers need is tools that help us find and fix issues in their existing software systems, created using the existing tools.
- The minute that code calls any code outside the known system, the scope of code-level solutions becomes greatly diminished.
- One [study found](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~shanlu/paper/hotos19_azure.pdf) that 21% of the cloud outages resulted from inconsistent data format assumptions across different software components and versions.
- By “design”, I mean reducing friction to help developers get to where they need to go
- Truly absorbing design into developer experience therefore requires a few key mindset shifts, especially for developer-tools purists:
  - Focus on the problem being solved
  - Focus on fitting into existing workflows: focus on more interoperability with existing dev tools
